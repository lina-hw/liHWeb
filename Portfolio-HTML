            <h2>This is the portfolio of Lina Högberg Wahlström</h2>

            <p id="introduction">
                During the years 2020-2023 I studied to become an Information Architect and Front-End Developer at Högskolan Borås in Sweden.
                I have a background in the transportations industry, working as a manager and bus driver, and also working as a personal trainer and group fitness instructor on the side. I am doing a career shift to be able to do something that I am passionate about, and to be able to work with something that I find energizing and inspiring. I am a creative person, and the transportations is a very rigid and rule based industry which had me feeling like I was in the wrong place for my ambition level.
                <br>
                The bachelors program gave me a lot of new skills, and also a more in depth  knowledge in subject I already had an interest in like video animation, graphical design and web development. During the education we have gone through programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, together with relative layout design, content management, SEO, graphic design, branding, text production and editing of visual sources. I learned how to use the Adobe Creative Cloud package, and have mostly been working in Illustrator, After Effects, Audition and Photoshop. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The second year I did a web design project with a real life collaborator, which will be more <span><a id="project_link" href="#project">presented below</a></span>. It was a very educational experience, giving the user centric perspective of a development greater meaning and I learned that the needs of a client is not always what the actual need is. The board of the association that I collaborated with wanted to have a more professional looking webpage with information about their activities, and in the evaluation process I realised that they also had a need for a informational platform and membership forum. I re-design their webpage whith this in mind, and created room for more social media presence and more user-friendly ways of interacting with the coaches, other members and the national and international organisation. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The user-friendly perspective has become a passion of mine, and to be able to bring through a message from a client with different elements of media. It is important to me that the things that I create for other people represent them and the messages that they want to communicate. I feel that it is my job to help my clients to expand their views and show them different versions of what they want, to pin-point the essence of their ambition and needs. I look forward to gaining more experience with different types of clients, to learn how to adapt to their individual brands and demands in their line of work. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides my professional career I have a family life with two beautiful children and a very supportive husband. We are an active family that likes to do sports, daily adventures on days off and to hang out and connect. Family is important, and the years of studies have thought me to plan my weeks ahead and have a clear agenda with deadlines and to prioritise. This have made me more focused on the tasks and assignments since time has been made to pay them my full attention. I have also learned to be more disciplined and finding tools that help me be able to disconnect from work and studies to be present with my children when we are together. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My current goal in my career is to get as much experience as possible to find out what I really like to do, what I am good at and what I need to have more practice in. You never stop learning. In the future I see myself as part of a strong development team, with a professional network in the business and making successful deliverables to our clients.

                I have through my working experiences developed a good set of leadership and communication skills.

                    <p><span>Assignment:</span> Find a company to collaboreate with and design or re-design their website.</p>
                    <p><span>Tools used:</span> Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, one.com online website-tool, text editor.</p>
                    <p><span>Collaborator:</span> Bushido Akademin IF</p>
                    <p><span>Description:</span> local karate association since 2011 with around 50 members. Their need was to get a more modern website, with general information about the training, the schedule and other relevant information. They wanted a place for new potential members and another for old members. The association was also in need of an updated strategy for social media and search engine optimisation. </p>

                    <h5>Old website:</h5>
                    <p>The old website was a static site, with some yearly changes for announcing session times.<br>
                        In the progress of recreating the webpage a content evaluation took place, to see what could be kept and what should be rewritten. The results gave the knowledge that the texts mostly was about the sport and the origin of kyokushin karate, and less about the association and the members, and the familliarity and sence of connection in the association does not shine through. The website was also bland in the color scheme, not giving the attitude and strong feeling sorrounds the training sessions. An initial survey was sent out to all the members to give them the opportunity to make inputs on what was important to them, since the webpage was supposed to be for them.</p>

                        </div>    


                    <h5>New website: <a id="bushido" href="https://bushidoakademin.se">bushidoakademin.se</a></h5>
                    <p>To let the power of the sport take more place in the new website the three traditional colors red, black and white was used. The aim for simplicity in the culture of karate was also a big influencer in the project together with the input from the members and the goal to have a relevant textual content. One big aspect was the need to have a good forum for announcements  of new information, therefor a new Facebook page was created, going from a closed group to an open business Facebook page. The page and the pre existing Instagram page was integrated in the index page of the website, making the first page the most dynamic in nature of all the pages, and making the management of the page less complicated. Some of the most frequently asked questions to the coaches in the association was about the schedule, so to fill this need a Google Calendar was created and also integrated on the index webpage.<br>
                    To make the pages more readable on tablets it was made with a single column layout and the web builder tool used at one.com had a usable mobile view, so the website is also readable on mobile devices. The website was also made with a SEO strategy in mind, to make it more visible on the web.<br> 
                    As a side project, out of scope for the school project, a marketing strategy was created together with videos and footage to upload to social media.<br>
                    One of the goals for the association was to get more new members, and during 2023 they had more than 60 new try out sessions generating in around 40 new members, 2 new beginner classes and 1900 new webpage users with an average engagement time of more then 1 minute (source: Google Analytics). One of the reasons could definitely be more visibility locally through social media ads and a locally strong brand.</p>

                    <h5>Additional media created for the association:</h5>
                    <p>These are some of the videos created for marketing purposes. They are intentionally a bit unpolished, with the aim to make them more authentic, and for the respect of the members in the clips not wanting to have a camera and lights in their face while working out. It is also a way of shoeing the viewers how the sessions actually are in real life and what they could expect when visiting the dojo.</p>
